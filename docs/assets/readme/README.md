# README Visual Assets

This directory is the public asset scaffold for the fork README and docs-index
visual proof surface.

Planned assets:

- `benchmark-delta-phase-p1.svg`
  - compact benchmark delta card for upstream vs P0 vs P1
- `compatibility-snapshot.svg`
  - compact compatibility wins panel
- `operator-quickstart-flow.svg`
  - 3-step start-here flow
- `profile-coverage-snapshot.svg`
  - small profile matrix / chip panel
- `goose-terminal-validation.png`
  - clean Goose compatibility screenshot after final public-ready capture
- `open-webui-connection.png`
  - Open WebUI connection screenshot after formal validation

Rules:

- only publish assets backed by data already recorded in repo docs or durable
  validation exports
- do not add new benchmark claims until they are reflected in:
  - `docs/benchmarks/fork-improvement-log.md`
- keep captions and labels backend-focused and evidence-backed

Current status:

- scaffold only
- no image assets published yet
